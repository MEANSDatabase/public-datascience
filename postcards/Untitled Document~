# MEANS Sample Postcard 

On Feb. 8th, 2016 MEANS sent out its second major round of postcards to potential user food pantries and emergency feeding locations across the US. 

We created two different designs and randomly distributed them across our mailing lists so that the same city would receive both card designs. 

We further sent ~250 hand addressed postcards, and about 750 typed-address postcards. 

In the ~month after the postcards were mailed, 89 new users signed up for MEANS. We analyzed which of those users received a postcard, and which did not.
