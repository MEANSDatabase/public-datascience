# MEANS Public Datascience

Pushing the state of public datascience for food recovery systems forward.

The MEANS database builds and refines several models related to our core efforts, such as
determining which food pantries across the US would benefit most from our nonprofit. Here we've published
some samples of our data and tiny bits of code that we're no longer using.

If you'd like to get in touch we'd love to hear from you.
